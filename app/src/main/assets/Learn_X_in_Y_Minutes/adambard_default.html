I made it because a customer for one of my other services had specific requirements
regarding the contents of their invoices, and I thought it might be useful.

A notable feature if this site is the
<a href='https://github.com/ztellman/lamina'>lamina</a>
queue it uses for messages.
On startup, it spins up a separate thread consuming from a lamina channel of
incoming posts. As people schedule their posts, they get added to the queue.
This architecture decouples the work of posting to reddit from the rest, but
more importantly spares me from paying
<a href='http://adambard.com/blog/why-clojure-part-2-async-magic/'>Heroku</a>
for a separate worker dyno. It also justifies the use of Clojure by actually
utilizing its

Wagr is the first application I made using Enlive and Middleman with Clojure.

both parties reminding them.

The email sending is a pretty simple cron job. I used Mongo again as the data

I learned a lot from writing this site, mostly that I'd better keep
Clojure to myself unless I was working with someone similarly enthused.
Still, Clojure managed to be fast to develop in and performant, even as
I worked through the problems of translating what I knew about other frameworks
to the functional paradigms underlying Clojure.
